### **Course content**

This course focuses on the foundational principles of probability theory and mathematical statistics, which are essential for solving complex engineering problems. It provides a detailed exploration of random events, probability distributions, statistical methods, and estimation techniques. Students will learn how to apply these methods to analyze data, perform statistical inference, and understand the behavior of random variables in various engineering contexts.

Key topics covered include:

1. **Events and Probability**: Random events, properties of probability, probability calculations, conditional probability, and independence.
2. **One-Dimensional Random Variables**: Definition and distribution of random variables, discrete random variables, special discrete distributions, continuous random variables, and special continuous distributions.
3. **Multidimensional Random Variables**: Joint distributions, marginal distributions, independence of random variables, and distributions of functions of random variables.
4. **Statistical Characteristics of Random Variables**: Mathematical expectation, variance, covariance, correlation coefficients, moments, and other statistical characteristics, including the central limit theorem.
5. **Foundations of Mathematical Statistics**: Population and sample, statistical quantities, sampling distributions.
6. **Parameter Estimation**: Moment estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, criteria for point estimation, confidence intervals, and confidence intervals for single and double normal population parameters.
7. **Hypothesis Testing**: Basic principles and steps of hypothesis testing, hypothesis testing for unknown parameters in single and double normal populations.
