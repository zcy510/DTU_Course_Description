### **Course content**

The course is a fundamental branch of mathematics that studies discrete elements and their structures. It provides the theoretical foundation for computer science, underpinning many areas such as algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computer networks.

The following topics are covered in the course:

1. Set Theory, including naive set theory, relations and functions.
2. Graph Theory, covers fundamental concepts, theories, and applications of graph theory, including graph representations, traversals, and algorithms for solving graph problems.
3. Combinatorics, exploring basic counting techniques, such as permutations and combinations.
