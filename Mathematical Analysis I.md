### **Course content**

This course is a foundational core subject for mathematics majors, distinct from Advanced Mathematics for non-math majors in its emphasis on rigorous reasoning and proof of mathematical problems. The course trains students in logical and abstract mathematical thinking, equipping them with problem-solving skills and a strong understanding of mathematical analysis concepts and methods.

Key topics covered include:

1. Real numbers, functions, and supremum principle
2. Sequences and function limits
3. Continuity and uniform continuity
4. Derivatives, higher-order derivatives, and differentials
5. Mean value theorems, Taylor series, and applications
6. Integration theory, including definite, indefinite, and improper integrals
7. Applications of integration, such as area, volume, curve length, and numerical approximations
