### **Course content**

This course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles and technologies of computer networks, with an emphasis on the development trends of networking technologies. The course is structured around the five-layer TCP/IP model and adopts a top-down approach to systematically introduce the operation principles and technologies of each layer.

Key topics covered include:

1. Introduction to Computer Networks and the Internet: Overview of networking concepts, Internet architecture, and protocol layering.
2. Application Layer: Study of application-layer protocols, including HTTP, FTP, DNS, and email protocols.
3. Transport Layer: Principles of reliable data transfer, congestion control, and protocols such as TCP and UDP.
4. Network Layer: Routing algorithms, IP addressing, and Internet routing protocols.
5. Data Link Layer and Local Area Networks: Concepts of error detection, flow control, and LAN technologies like Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
6. Network Simulations: Use of simulation tools for modeling and analyzing network behaviors (optional advanced topics for self-study).
