### **Course Content**

This course introduces students to the fundamental principles and applications of computer-assisted education (CAE). It covers the historical development, types of CAE, and key technologies, including Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI), Computer-Managed Instruction (CMI), online learning platforms, and intelligent computer-assisted instruction (ICAI). The course emphasizes the integration of computer-based education (CBE) principles with educational applications and the development process of CAE systems. Students will gain hands-on experience in designing and developing CAI courseware, online courses, and educational management systems, as well as understanding the evaluation methods used in CBE.

Key topics include:

1. **Overview of Computer-Assisted Education (CBE)**: Development of CAE, its role in educational transformation, and future trends.
2. **CBE Theoretical Foundations**: Basic principles, models, and foundational theories of CBE.
3. **CAI Courseware Development**: Design and development principles of CAI, including courseware design, types, and development processes.
4. **Online Course Development**: Creation of online courses, teaching strategies, and the integration of network-based learning.
5. **CBE Evaluation**: Evaluation concepts, methods, and standards for assessing the effectiveness of CAE systems.
6. **Computer-Assisted Instruction Management (CMI)**: Overview of CMI systems, their structure, applications, and role in managing educational content and assessments.
7. **Online Learning Platforms**: Introduction to platforms such as MOOCs and SPOCs, and their role in online education.
8. **Intelligent Computer-Assisted Instruction (ICAI)**: Development and research trends of ICAI, and comparison with traditional CAI.
9. **Future of Computer-Assisted Education**: Latest computer technologies, their potential for enhancing education, and emerging trends in CAE.
