### **Course content**

This course provides an introduction to the field of computer science, focusing on self-directed learning and practical programming exercises. Instead of traditional knowledge transmission, students are encouraged to engage in hands-on learning, collaborate with peers, and design and implement a fun game program as a final project. The course covers fundamental topics in computer science and programming using Python.

Key topics covered include:

1. Introduction to computer science and its applications
2. Basic programming concepts and Python syntax
3. Algorithms and problem-solving strategies
4. Data representation and logical operations
5. Understanding how programs execute on hardware
6. Recursion and common algorithms such as dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer
7. Introduction to operating systems
