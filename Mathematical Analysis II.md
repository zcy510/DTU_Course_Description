### **Course content**

This course is a core foundational subject for mathematics majors, focusing on rigorous reasoning and proofs in mathematical problems, as opposed to the more application-oriented approach of calculus for non-math majors. It aims to provide students with special training in logical and abstract mathematical thinking, fostering analytical problem-solving skills.

The course covers systematic knowledge of series and multivariable calculus, including:

1. Convergence and properties of numerical series.
2. Function sequences and power series.
3. Fourier series and their applications.
4. Multivariable functions: limits, continuity, and differentiability.
5. Implicit function theorems and constrained optimization.
6. Parameter-dependent integrals and their properties.
7. Line, surface, and volume integrals, with fundamental theorems of calculus.
8. Introduction to ordinary differential equations.
