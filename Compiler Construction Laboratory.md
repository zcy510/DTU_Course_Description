### **Course content**

This course provides practical experience in designing and implementing a compiler for a simple programming language, PL/0. Students will apply the principles learned in the Compiler Theory course to real-world applications, using tools like Lex and Yacc for lexical analysis and syntax parsing. The course focuses on enhancing students' practical skills in compiler construction, error handling, semantic analysis, and code generation.

Key topics covered include:

1. Lexical Analysis: The process of converting input text into tokens.
2. Syntax Analysis: The process of analyzing the grammatical structure of source code for generating parsers.
3. Semantic Analysis: Techniques for checking the correctness of the program's logic, including type checking and scope resolution.
4. Error Handling: Approaches for detecting, reporting, and recovering from errors in the compiler design.
5. Symbol Tables: Construction and management of symbol tables for storing information about variables, functions, and other symbols.
6. Intermediate Code Generation: Creation of intermediate representations of the source code for further optimization and target code generation.
7. Target Code Generation: The process of generating assembly or machine code from intermediate representations.
8. Compiler Optimization: Basic techniques for optimizing generated code to improve performance and reduce size.
9. Testing and Debugging: Techniques for testing the compiler, including creating test cases, analyzing results, and debugging the compiler code.
