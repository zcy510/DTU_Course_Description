### **Course content**

This course focuses on hands-on experimentation to deepen studentsâ€™ understanding of computer system structures and operations. It is designed as a complement to the Computer Organization and Architecture course and introduces students to the practical principles of computer hardware and instruction systems. Students perform experiments on dedicated experimental boards, using both manual and instruction-based controls to manipulate data and verify computer operations.

The course covers essential topics such as:

1. Computer Components and Operations: Hands-on exploration of hardware components and their roles in data processing.
2. Data Pathways: Observation and analysis of data movement between computer components.
3. Model Verification: Verification of operational principles using a model computer.
4. Microprogramming Design: Design and implementation of microprograms to execute custom instruction sets.
5. Instruction System Development: Development of machine-level programs using the designed instruction system.
